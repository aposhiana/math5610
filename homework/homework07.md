### Seventh task set

1. 
2. 
3. I implemented a routine called `steepestDescentSolve` that computes and returns an approximate solution to a linear system of equations using the method of steepest descent. [See my software manual entry](../software_manual/steepestDescentSolve.md).
4. 
5. I implemented a routine called `cg` that computes and returns an approximate solution to a linear system of equations using the conjugate gradient method. [See my software manual entry](../software_manual/cg.md).
