### Second task set

1. I emailed the link to my GitHub pages to the professor.
2. I wrote a function which computes and returns the absolute error between two floating point numbers. [See my software manual entry](../software_manual/absoluteError.md)
3. I wrote a function which computes and returns the relative error between two floating point numbers. [See my software manual entry](../software_manual/relativeError.md)
4. I wrote a function that adds two vectors of the same length. My function can accepts both Vector and DenseArray instances in order to support elementwise addition of matrices as well. [See my software manual entry](../software_manual/add.md)
5. I wrote a function that returns a scalar multiple of a Vector or DenseArray. I overloaded this method so that it also supports accepting two Array objects in order to return the result of an elementwise multiplication. [See my software manual entry](../software_manual/multiply.md)
6. I wrote a function that computes the 2-norm of an arbitrary vector with real entries. [See my software manual entry](../software_manual/l2Norm.md)
7. I wrote a function that computes the 1-norm of an arbitrary vector with real entries. [See my software manual entry](../software_manual/l1Norm.md)
8. I wrote a function that computes the infinity-norm of an arbitrary vector with real entries. [See my software manual entry](../software_manual/infNorm.md)
9. I wrote a method that generates a symmetric matrix with random real values. [See my software manual entry](../software_manual/makeRandomSymmetric.md)
